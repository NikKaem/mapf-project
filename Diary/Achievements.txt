 7.01.2021 -> Conflict Edges Detection and Solution 
14.01.2021 -> Vertex Conflict Detection and Solution (Special Cases missing)
21.01.2021 -> Started actually working on diary, multiple weekly meetings, Set goals, started working on special cases
28.01.2021 -> Realized we probably have to start from scratch -> Multiple robots are not solvable (in an efficient manner)
	   -> Looked at Sciencitific Papers to get an idea and created an new idea ourselves as well
02.02.2021 -> Started working on Constraint merger ( Using the CBS constraint Idea and fusing this with the ASP generate everything approach)
10.02.2021 -> Created merger that solves all possible instances (hopefully). Implemented the constraint idea and started beautify (aufhÃ¼bschen) the program.
18.02.2021 -> Benchmarker script finished, Plan Creator script finished, Plan Renamer script finished, started benchmarking, created multiple merger variants (constraint-global, random-global, constraint-heuristics), started working on change_time approaches, restructuring of the repository
25.02.2021 -> Benchmarker script now outputs seperately per approach, Added 5 different heuristics for random moves, evaluated these 5 different approaches in R
04.03.2021 -> Benchmarker script now only iterates the solution 10 times. Added around 30 Benchmarks. Created Random Benchmark creator. massively updated data analysis with R. Started Benchmarking all Approaches.
