This is our approach of constraint learning


Basically what we do at the moment is:

Take Initial Plans
Check for Conflicts
If Conflict, copy initial plans till one step before the conflict and then randomly generate moves.

We check for conflicts after generating plans 
And every plan that is conflict free is outputted as a solution
