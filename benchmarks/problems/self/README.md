## Benchmarking

To the different components we included Benchmarks.

### Categories
The benchmarks are all sorted according to their estimated difficulty for the plan merger (or other components).
The Category with the least estimated problems is "Easy".
Usually examples here include conflicts, but there are many different moves possible, and some can even be solved without conflict with an efficient assignment of robots to shelfs.

One Step after the "Easy" category is the "Medium" Category. 
Examples here always include conflicts, some with limited amounts of possible moves. 

The most difficult category is "Hard".
Examples here are tough to solve and are more for finetuning components like the plan merger.
(Currently there are no examples of Hard difficulty)

### Meta Data to each Benchmark
All Benchmarks include a Text File explaining the idea behind them and some meta information, i.e. what is the minimal amount of steps needed to solve this.
