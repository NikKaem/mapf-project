## About

This repository was created as a part of the "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning" - Project. The baseline was imported from https://github.com/potassco/asprilo and https://github.com/potassco/asprilo-encodings and extended by Marius Wawerek and Niklas Kaemmer. We will include benchmarks and our own solutions to the multi-agent path-finding problem.
