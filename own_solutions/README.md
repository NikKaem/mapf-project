## Our Solutions

Currently you can find two distinct programs that we created.
The first one being an conflict finder and the other one being an plan merger.

The conflict finder can be found in the directory "conflict_finder"
It takes two (or more) plans as input and outputs conflict predicates.
These predicates show where an conflict has occured and which type of conflict it is.
Currently we distinguish 2 types of conflicts (marked by 0 and 1 respectively).


The plan merger can be found in the directory "plan_merger_1".
It takes two (or more) plans as input and outputs a joint plan without conflicts.

Known Problems:
We are aware that in their current implementations both programs take a lot of time to run.
This will be changed in future releases.
